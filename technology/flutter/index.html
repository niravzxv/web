					<h2>Agile Cross-Platform App Development - Flutter</h2>
					<p>Flutter runs on <b>iOS</b> and <b>Android</b> as an open-source software development kit (SDK).
						In contrast to hybrid applications, Flutter does not require bridging to communicate with the
						operating system. Instead, it has customizable widgets that you can use to build an agile and
						adaptable user interface. The primary feature of Flutter is real-time UI iteration, enabling it
						to have exceptional design capabilities. Moreover, Flutter code is instantaneously visible on
						the app screen, and development and code updates are more straightforward and faster with
						Flutter than with alternative app development platforms. Flutter also enables you to create
						cross-platform apps that are responsive and functional on various platforms, including iOS and
						Android.
					</p>
					<h3>Hire Flutter Developers</h3>
					<p>We understand the importance of a visually distinctive brand identity that enhances your
						business. As a Flutter app development company, we ensure that our use of Material Design &
						Cupertino components in your applications is highly customizable, delivering a native-like
						experience on any platform. Our developers at Shivay infotechcreate applications that are both

						cross-platform apps as Flutter app developers, reducing errors, speeding up development, and
						maximizing ROI. Additionally, our dependable Flutter application developers work with
						enterprises and businesses to design high-quality native interfaces that are compatible with
						multiple platforms. These elements combine to create an app with a flexible, expressive user
						interface, robust architecture, and impressive features.</p>
