					<h2>What Is HandlebarsJS?</h2>
					<p>HandlebarsJS is a primary templating language. It is the most extensively used templating
						library, enabling static web applications to dynamic web applications with well-designed,
						modular user interfaces. With the help of a template and an input object, it generates HTML or
						other text formats. Handlebars templates resemble conventional text with Handlebars expressions
						included. In addition, the handlebars turn templates into JavaScript functions, resulting in a
						faster template execution speed than most other template engines.</p>
					<p>With Handlebars, HTML pages are kept clean by decoupling JavaScript code from irrational
						templates. It also benefits the application's architecture and manageability. Additionally, it
						aids in the flexible update of a view's data. Eventually, it is a templating engine that enables
						server-side and client-side applications.</p>
					<h3>Reasons To Use Handlerbars.js</h3>
					<p>Handlebars is a highly advanced, feature-rich, and popular JavaScript template engine with the
						most established community. It resembles standard HTML, with integrated handlebars expressions
						within the curly brackets. However, compiling the data with Handlebars is a simple matter of a
						few lines. It is a logic-free templating engine, which means that your HTML page's templates
						include very little logic. Unlike other templating engines, Handlebars' principal purpose is to
						keep your HTML pages simple, tidy, and independent of JavaScript logic, which it excels at.</p>
